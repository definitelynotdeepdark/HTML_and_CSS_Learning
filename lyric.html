            Slip inside the eye of your mind
            Don't you know you might find
            A better place to play?
            You said that you'd never been
            But all the things that you've seen
            Slowly fade away
            
            So I start a revolution from my bed
            'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
            Step outside, summertime's in bloom
            Stand up beside the fireplace
            Take that look from off your face
            You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
            
            And so, Sally can wait
            She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by
            Her soul slides away
            But "Don't look back in anger," I heard you say
            
            Take me to the place where you go
            Where nobody knows
            If it's night or day
            Please don't put your life in the hands
            Of a rock 'n' roll band
            Who'll throw it all away

            I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
            'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
            Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
            Stand up beside the fireplace
            Take that look from off your face
            'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
            
            And so, Sally can wait
            She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
            My soul slides away
            But "Don't look back in anger," I heard you say
            
            So, Sally can wait
            She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
            Her soul slides away
            But "Don't look back in anger," I heard you say
            So, Sally can wait
            She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
            My soul slides away
            But "Don't look back in anger
            Don't look back in anger"
            I heard you say
        
            "At least not today
