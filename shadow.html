        Maybe I don't really wanna know
        How your garden grows
        'Cause I just wanna fly
        Lately, did you ever feel the pain
        In the morning rain
        As it soaks you to the bone?
        Maybe I just wanna fly
        Wanna live, I don't wanna die
        Maybe I just wanna breathe
        Maybe I just don't believe
        Maybe you're the same as me
        We see things they'll never see
        You and I are gonna live forever</div></pre>
